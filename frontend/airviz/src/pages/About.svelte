    <h1>About This App</h1>
    <p>
        This project is a proof-of-concept for a low-cost cloud visualisation platform for near-real-time sensor data, for resource-constrained organisations to develop and present to their target audience. 

        This platform ingests hourly air quality data (different pollutant concentrations, air quality index and health recommendations) for each map tile within Greater London, and presents it to the public audience with interactive visualisations. It also consists of an admin monitoring dashboard for developers to observe operational metrics, such as response latency and costs.
